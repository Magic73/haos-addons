      The list of routes to add.  The nexthop is the existing IPv4
      address on the LOCAL subnet that acts as the gateway to the
      network or IP you are adding a route for.  This should really
      be a static IP.
      The network is the IPv4 IP or network/netmask you add adding
      a route for.  Needs to be in the form of a raw IP (eg,
      192.168.4.1) or a network/netmask in CIDR format (eg,
      192.168.4.1/24).
