# Slyglif's Home Assistant add-on repository
This repo will contain various add-ons I have needed.

## Add-ons
This repo contains the following add-ons

### [Powerwall 3 to MQTT](./powerwall3mqtt)
A simple Home Assistant Add On that acts as a bridge between the Powerwall 3 TEDAPI and MQTT.

### [Static Route Manager](./staticroutes)
An add-on that will add or remove static routes to HAOS.  Useful for connecting to the Powerwall 3 TEDAPI when the PW3 is on the same network as HAOS.
